# Revised_Ec2
This code will allow creating, describing, rebooting, stopping, starting, and terminating an EC2 instance

This project allow the user to do all of the above in their aws console. In order to run this code, the user needs to do a few things. First, install the aws cli and configure your aws credentials. After, go into the aws console and create a user, get the AMi number and paste this into the ImageId. Finally paste this within a source code editor or IDE (I used vscode). After pasting you can uncomment the functions below and choose which one to call. I recommend going down the list in order. 

This project is useful as it taught me how to create and manage basic functionality of an EC2 instance, while also teaching me how to share my work with others and have them test it or allow me to demo properly. 

For any help gathering the above data necessary, a quick google search should take you to AWS's website and they have several step by step guides as to how to do everything.
